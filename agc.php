Typically, RAS are intended to take specific protective measures to prevent the spread of large disturbances under heavy system loading conditions.<br><br> However, the attacker intelligently triggers the operation of this RAS by creating a data integrity attack on unencrypted communication between the substation and the control center that uses the DNP3 protocol. In order to create a cascading outage, the attacker also blocks the communication between the protection relays that are involved in the RAS through a targeted Denial of Service (DoS) attack on one of the protection controllers.<br><br>This prevents the successful operation of the RAS and in turn initiates secondary protection to be tripped to avoid thermal overload on the impacted transmission line. As a result of this coordinated attack involving data integrity attack to trip a breaker and a DoS attack on RAS communications, the overall system frequency is also affected as it causes the islanding of a generator from the rest of the system.</font></div>

This attack is a version of the classic Man-in-the-Middle attack, where the attacker intercepts the communication between the control center and the remote substations and chooses to stealthily modify either the frequency and tie-line measurements going to the control center, or the AGC control commands going to the generating stations. <br><br> This is achieved by executing an ARP poisoning attack first, which tricks the remote substation to forward the data to the attacker before sending it to the external gateway. The attacker then selects the appropriate information that is to be replaced and modifies it appropriately using custom attack scripts and forwards it to the external gateway.<br><br>  As a result of this manipulation, there is a steady frequency deviation in the system. Eventually, this frequency deviation causes the load in the system to be shed in an attempt to restore frequency. A sustained attack could potentially lead to a major portion of the load in the power system to be unserved.</font></div>

The attacker performs a stealthy attack where he exploits his knowledge about the measurement configurations at multiple substations to carefully select the locations where he would manipulate the measurements. <br><br> The attack vector involves the classic Man-in-the-Middle attack, where the attacker tricks the RTU to forward all its data to the attacker machine instead of the substation gateway using an ARP poisoning attack. By decoding the unencrypted network traffic, the attacker selects and modifies appropriately certain targeted measurements to avoid detection by the State Estimator Bad Data Detectors.<br><br>  This does not cause any bad data alarms in the control center and consequently, the attacker succeeds in impeding the situational awareness capabilities of the operator. Consequently, all applications that rely on State Estimator would be affected such as Contingency Analysis, Power Markets, etc., Also, this attack could be used to further trigger other attacks that could cause additional damage such as opening/overloading critical transmission lines.</font></div>

The attacker uses this for an unauthorized opening of a distribution feeder breaker feeding a major manufacturing industry connected directly on the 40 KV level. The attacker intention is to create a power outage that will severely disturb or stop the production in a continuously operated plant in order to create economical and/or physical damage.</font></div>
